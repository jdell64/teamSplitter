# Team splitter

**This is still a work in progress**

## how to use this script

1. create a csv file with your team in it. Use their player name, total PI, and whether you think they are a boss killer as fields:

    somePlayer,123456,True
    otherPlayer123,99991,False
    ...

1. Run the file "teamsplitter.py" with your csv as input:

   > teamsplitter.py myTeam.csv

1. Your teams will be output to "groups.txt" if you did everything right.
